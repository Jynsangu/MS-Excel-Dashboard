# MS Excel Dasboard 

The Dashboard is a sample representation of Prevention of Mother to Children Transmission of HIV. 



## Summary

The Dashboard represents a fictional County consisting of Sub Counties, Regions and Health centres. 

The PMTCT Dashboard shows the Retention rate of HIV Positive mothers who visit the PMTCT clinics with or without HIV Exposed Infants. The Retention is based on a net cohort of mothers who have been continuously accessing services for 12 Months and 24 Months and those who have remained active.

The HEI Dashboard shows data on the HIV Exposed Infants who have been in the 12 Month and 24 Cohort respectively. The dashboard seeks to visually preent those who remained active from the initial Net cohort and were PCR Negative at the end of the specified periods. In addition, attributes that are considered vital to HEI follow ups are shown which include death, Loss to follow up, transfer out and turning HIV Negative.
